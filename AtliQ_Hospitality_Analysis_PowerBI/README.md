# 🏨 AtliQ Hospitality Analysis – Power BI Project

This project was created as part of the Codebasics September Resume Challenge. It focuses on solving a real-world business problem for a hospitality chain using Power BI and data analytics.

### 📌 Problem Statement

Client: AtliQ Grands – a luxury hotel chain operating across India for over 20 years.

Challenge:
Due to increasing competition and ineffective decision-making, AtliQ Grands is losing market share and revenue. The management has decided to adopt Business & Data Intelligence strategies but lacks an internal data analytics team.

They have approached a third-party data consultant to:

Build data models.

Generate actionable insights.

Design executive dashboards to improve strategic decisions.

### ✅ Objectives & Tasks

As the data analyst, I am tasked with:

📊 Creating Metrics: Build KPIs based on a predefined metric list.

🧩 Dashboard Design: Develop dashboards aligned with stakeholder-provided mock-ups.

💡 Insights Generation: Extract additional valuable insights not explicitly asked for.
